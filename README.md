### Course Description

The goal of this course is to expose students to the fundamentals of web development. This is a continuation of the Fall 2020 course that focused on HTML and CSS. In this course, students are introduced to Javascript, a building block of modern web development. The course is also geared towards providing an introduction into the discipline of software engineering, with a particular focus on leveraging industry best practices and working standards. By the end of this course, students will be able to build simple, static web applications and have a broad understanding about the impact software has had on the world and the opportunities that lie ahead from a career perspective.

### Course Materials

As part of each lesson, we will recommend reading materials, videos, and other resources useful to maximizing learning as part of the program. For further advanced reading, we recommend the following texts: 

*   _HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites_, by Jon Duckett
*   _CSS In Depth_, by Keith J. Grant
*   _You Don’t Know JS: The Series_, by Kyle Simpson
*   _[Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)_, by Mozilla

### Course Requirements

*   Linux-based computer with internet connection (DSL, LAN, or cable connection desirable) and terminal sudo access
*   Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, or similar software program
*   Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browser

### Course Structure

This is a hands-on course comprising lectures and workshops. Lectures will be held in the first half of each 3-hour class and will focus on core concepts. They will be recorded for future reference. The second half of the class will comprise hands-on workshops where students will put to practice key concepts learned during the lectures. Each class will be accompanied with light assignments to be completed in anticipation of the following class. All course activities and resources will be shared via Google Classroom. As part of the course, students will also be expected to work in groups of five to build a product in collaboration with a local organization. Products will be demoed during the last week of the course.

**Important Note:** This syllabus, along with course assignments and due dates, is subject to change. It is the student’s responsibility to check our weekly email updates and announcements for corrections or updates to the syllabus. Any changes will be clearly noted in course announcements.

## Course Policies

### Participation

Students are expected to attend all lectures and workshop sessions. They are also expected to be highly engaged by asking questions when they’re unclear about something or are curious about something they’re interested in. If students miss to attend sessions for more than two weeks without an acceptable reason, they will be automatically dropped from the course.

### Build Rapport

If you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let your instructor know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing your instructor when difficulties arise during the semester so that we can help you find a solution.

### Complete Assignments

**All assignments for this course will be submitted electronically via personal GitHub accounts to be set up separately following instructor instructions unless otherwise instructed.** Assignments must be submitted by the given deadline or special permission must be requested from the instructor _before the due date_. Extensions will not be given beyond the next assignment except under extreme circumstances.

### Inform Your Instructor of Any Accommodations Needed

If you have a disability and would like to request accommodations, please contact the instructor during the first week of the semester so that your accommodations may be provided in a timely manner.
